# CalculatorProject-with-API
Me and my team created a project of calculator.

There in one html page called Calculator.html, which consumes the Json API and gives the answer of the expression in Json.
It also handel's the error. If user directly enter the operand and perform calculation then it show number 1 and number 2 are missing.
There is one another API, which gives output in XML format.

There is one documentation page called index.html. 
Which contains the information how the API is working and what parameter it accepts.
